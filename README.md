# Homework 7 - Image Gallery

This repository includes two image galleries created using different libraries: BasicLightbox and SimpleLightbox. Each gallery is implemented in a separate HTML file and associated JavaScript files (`01-gallery.js` and `02-lightbox.js`). The project also utilizes common styles defined in the `common.css` file.

## Task Descriptions

### 01-gallery.html - BasicLightbox Gallery
- **File**: `01-gallery.html`
- **Libraries Used**: [BasicLightbox](https://basiclightbox.electerious.com/)
- **Description**: This page features an image gallery created using BasicLightbox. Each image is displayed in a grid, and clicking on an image opens it in a lightbox view.

### 02-lightbox.html - SimpleLightbox Gallery
- **File**: `02-lightbox.html`
- **Libraries Used**: [SimpleLightbox](https://simplelightbox.com/)
- **Description**: This page showcases an image gallery implemented with SimpleLightbox. Similar to the first gallery, clicking on an image opens it in a lightbox for a closer view.

## Common Styles (`common.css`)
- **Description**: The `common.css` file provides basic styling for the project, including a reset for box-sizing, font styles, and a simple grid layout for the galleries.

## Styles (`css/styles.css`)
- **Description**: Additional styles specific to the galleries are defined in the `styles.css` file. These include styling for the gallery container, individual items, and the hover effects.

Feel free to explore the code, run the HTML files in a web browser, and interact with the image galleries. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
